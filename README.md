### **1. Bug and Error Analysis on a Web Page (Case Assignment)**

You are given a website that needs to be tested, provided as a link to an archive with the source files.
To access it, download the archive, unzip it, and open the `index.html` file in your browser.

The design mockup is in Figma:

Check the site for the following issues:

* **Cross-browser compatibility** (test in different browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
* **Responsiveness** (check how the page looks on different devices and screen sizes: mobile, tablet, desktop).
* **Performance** (measure how long the page takes to load using tools like Google Lighthouse or others).
* **Layout issues** (e.g., incorrect spacing, mismatch with the design).
* **Technical errors** (e.g., non-working forms, buttons, or dynamic elements).

**Instructions:**

* For each point, list the errors or areas of improvement you found.
* Describe how each issue can be fixed (if it‚Äôs possible from your side).
* Attach screenshots or links to performance and responsiveness test results (e.g., from Google Lighthouse, BrowserStack).

### **2. Code Quality Check (Case Assignment)**

You are given a code snippet. Your task is:

* Evaluate whether the code follows best practices.
* Identify any mistakes or code quality issues (e.g., non-compliance with standards, optimization problems).
* Suggest improvements or fixes.

**Code snippet (example):**

```html
<div class="header">
  <h1>–î–æ–±—Ä–æ –ø–æ–∂–∞–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –Ω–∞ –Ω–∞—à —Å–∞–π—Ç</h1>
  <p>–ú—ã —Ä–∞–¥—ã –≤–∞—Å –≤–∏–¥–µ—Ç—å!</p>
  <a href="/about-us">–û –Ω–∞—Å</a>
</div>
```

### **3. Analysis and Feedback**

Imagine you received a layout for review from a developer.
The developer submitted a page with a data input form. However:

* The form does not function correctly (data is not being submitted),
* The form is not responsive,
* The styles violate the brand‚Äôs design guidelines,
* You only have access to the frontend (no server-side access),
* The layout doesn‚Äôt fully match the requirements of the technical specification.

**Your tasks:**

* How would you describe the detected issues in the form of **constructive feedback**?
* How would you suggest improving the design or code to meet the requirements?
* Describe how you would **explain to the developer** the importance of following the technical specifications and standards.

### **4. Open Questions**

* What do you value more when reviewing code: **readability** or **performance**? Why?
* How do you test a website‚Äôs **cross-browser compatibility**? What tools do you use for this?
* What are the **core principles** of responsive testing? What special considerations do you keep in mind for mobile versions?
* What approaches do you use to analyze and improve **website performance**?
* How would you organize the **web application testing process** in your team?
